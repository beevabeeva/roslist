# roslist
Simple script that checks if a ros package is installed.

# Setup:
1. Save the ```roslist.bash``` file somewhere (e.g in ~). You may need to edit the path in ```roslist.bash``` (line 2) to your ros include folder (default is ```/opt/ros/melodic/include/```).

2. Add an alias to your .bashrc file:

  ```alias roslist='. ~/roslist.bash'```
  
  # Usage:
  
  ```roslist package_name```

  ## Example:
  
   ![asdf](https://github.com/beevabeeva/roslist/blob/master/asdf.jpg)
   
   
   ![asdf2](https://github.com/beevabeeva/roslist/blob/master/sucks.jpg)
